- Reverse-scaffolded WideWorldImporters DB.
- Implemented EFMigrations Layer by following [Microsoft Doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/projects?tabs=vs). Use case is for instances of multiple Migration files being added during Development, especially for large DBs.
